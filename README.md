# Solving the Job Shop Scheduling Problem using Tabu Search Algorithm
The implementation of the Taboo Search algorithm on the job shop schedule problem.

## Description
The schedule is created for a seven day period and is assumed to be repeated from then on. The user can enter the number of employees and their shifts as well as eventual working hour preferences of the workers. A list of jobs is also received as an input and finally the qualifications of each worker to each job is also given as the input. Next the standard taboo search algorithm is implemented to find the optimal schedule based on input parameters.
